I’ve continued to handle SSL cert renewals across all Rancher clusters, making sure everything stays secure and available. Regular patching for Rancher, Kubernetes, Calico, and Undercloud has also been part of my ongoing routine to keep things stable and up to date.

This cycle, I renewed the Rancher API key to ensure integrations remained seamless, and I also completed the wildcard cert renewals across all regions. On top of that, I updated the IPA CA signing certificates in production and supported onboarding of Kyverno governance policies to tighten up policy control across the board.

I’ve also been involved in refining our permission model to better enforce QoS constraints.

Overall, I’ve stayed focused on keeping our infrastructure secure, reliable, and ready to support the business without disruption.



Mid-Year Employee Comments:

I’ve continued supporting critical infrastructure services through customer engagement, namespace deployments, IP pool management, and customer application integration—all while improving support documentation to enhance usability and platform experience.

In addition to these ongoing efforts, I contributed to a number of key infrastructure changes this cycle, including:

Shutdown of VKS OSTICK undercloud components across all QA and PROD VKS regions
Updated resolv.conf for all VKS infra and Kubernetes nodes to align with new DC-specific addressing
Updated Messaging Keytab across OpenStack regions
Modified DNS SRV records, Calico NetworkSets, and Rancher configs following IPA server decommissioning in SPE
Completed VKS PROD hypervisor conversion to workload cluster workers
As part of the VKS8 rollout, I also:

Decommissioned legacy VKS storage hardware (ASH3)
Created new Designate zones for VKS8 management clusters
Created DNS records for QA2 MGMT Ingress
Created OOB DNS records for the QA2 buildout
