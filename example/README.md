I’ve continued to handle SSL cert renewals across all Rancher clusters, making sure everything stays secure and available. Regular patching for Rancher, Kubernetes, Calico, and Undercloud has also been part of my ongoing routine to keep things stable and up to date.

This cycle, I renewed the Rancher API key to ensure integrations remained seamless, and I also completed the wildcard cert renewals across all regions. On top of that, I updated the IPA CA signing certificates in production and supported onboarding of Kyverno governance policies to tighten up policy control across the board.

I’ve also been involved in refining our permission model to better enforce QoS constraints.

Overall, I’ve stayed focused on keeping our infrastructure secure, reliable, and ready to support the business without disruption.
