Just wanted to say thanks to everyone for the support and teamwork during my time here. I still remember when we first started supporting the platform — it was just the two of us, and then more folks joined along the way. Going from a single app deployed on the cluster to hundreds has been an incredible journey, and I’m really proud of where we are now.

Thanks again to everyone — and especially to Matt. You’re one of the most brilliant people I’ve ever worked with, and at the same time one of the most humble. You never shy away from helping others, and you always do it in a way that never makes anyone feel dumb.

I remember one of our early conversations when we started this journey. I asked you, “How long have you been messing with Kubernetes?” You said about three months. Then I asked if there were any courses you’d recommend, and you pointed me to Kelsey Hightower’s GitHub repo. I followed the structure there and set up my own environment on GCP using the $300 free tier. Whenever I ran into issues, I’d reach out — “hey, this and that” — and you’d calmly guide me on what to do. Even outside of work, you were always willing to help. Thanks again, man. I truly appreciate everything.

To folks joining Verisign, I want to be clear that this is a great company. The number of people leaving within a short time frame shouldn’t be seen as a reflection of the culture or the people here — this place is solid because of the people.

My situation is more personal. The last few weeks have been overwhelming, and I noticed myself underperforming. Rather than push through half-present, I’ve decided to step away to focus on my family and fully disconnect from work for a bit so I can reset and get myself back to where I need to be.

I’m grateful for everything I’ve learned here, for the people I’ve worked with, and for the support along the way. I wish everyone nothing but continued success.
