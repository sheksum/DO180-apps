How to Explain It
“We create two separate SVMs on NetApp—one for infrastructure, one for applications. Each has its own network, its own IPs, its own performance policies.
Infrastructure SVM handles things like the container registry, logging, and monitoring. These are critical—if they go down, we lose visibility into the cluster.
Application SVM handles whatever developers deploy. If an app goes crazy writing logs or doing heavy database work, it can’t impact the infrastructure storage.
The OpenShift nodes have NICs on both networks, so they can reach both SVMs.”
