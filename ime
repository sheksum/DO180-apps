Hey, issue resolved. Basically killing two birds with one stone — node failing to join the cluster, coredns failing, and NFD pods crashlooping were all the same root cause. OVN-K creates the network connection on the fly without DNS, so after a reboot NetworkManager generates resolv.conf with no nameservers and kubelet just hangs forever. You can't nmcli fix it either because RHCOS wipes /run/ on every boot.
Dropped a MachineConfig that lays down a permanent NM config forcing DNS on all connections plus a systemd service that covers the early boot window. Both GPU workers rolled and validated, DNS persists across reboots now. Everything is in Git under ArgoCD.
