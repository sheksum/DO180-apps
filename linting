# VKS Ops / SRE Onboarding Guide

This page outlines the required access, setup steps, and resources for engineers onboarding into the **VKS Ops / SRE** team.

It focuses on **what access is required** and **what VKS Ops must be set up**, while linking to authoritative documentation where detailed steps already exist.

---

## 1. Accesses

The following accesses are required for all VKS Ops / SRE resources.

- **RedHat IdM (IPA)**  
  New hire must be added to the appropriate  
  **[VKS IPA group](https://wiki.vrsn.com/spaces/VKS/pages/IPA+Groups)**

- **GitHub**  
  New hire must be added to the **vks-ops** team under:  
  **[https://github.vrsn.com/vks](https://github.vrsn.com/vks)**

- **Jira**  
  New hire must be added to the  
  **[VKS Support Jira project](https://jira.vrsn.com/projects/VKS)**  
  with visibility to all relevant VKS boards.

- **Netcool**  
  Submit an access request to the  
  **[VKS Ops Netcool filter](https://wiki.vrsn.com/spaces/VKS/pages/Netcool+Access)**  
  Reference an existing approved ticket when submitting your request  
  (example: **[MALTSUP-643](https://jira.vrsn.com/browse/MALTSUP-643)**).

- **Wiz**  
  Submit an access request to the  
  **[Wiz dashboard](https://wiz.io/)**  
  Reference an existing approved **[ticket](https://jira.vrsn.com/)** as a guide when submitting your request.

### Notes

- Jira, GitHub, Netcool, and Wiz use **VCorp credentials**  
  (the same credentials used to connect to the corporate VPN).
- **RedHat IdM (IPA)** access is managed separately.

---

## 2. Request a VDE

A **Virtual Desktop Environment (VDE)** is required for all VKS operational work.

Use the following page to request a VDE:

- **[Requesting a VDE](../vde/requesting-a-vde.md)**

---

## 3. Setting Up a Newly Issued VDE

Once you have received VDE access, set up both **VDE CLI** and **GUI** access.

---

### 3.1 Set Up VDE CLI Access

Set up the VDE CLI on your VDE.  
This provides command-line access required for VKS operational work.

Use the guide below:

- **[VDE CLI – Onboarding](../vde/vde-cli-onboarding.md)**

---

### 3.2 Request and Set Up GUI Access via noMachine on the VDE

Request and set up GUI access via **noMachine** on the VDE.

This enables access to Kubernetes-related dashboards and web interfaces such as:

- Rancher  
- Rook Ceph  
- Calico  
- Grafana  

Guide:

- **[VDE – GUI Access via noMachine](../vde/vde-gui-nomachine.md)**

---

## 4. Git Repository Access

VKS operational tooling and automation are maintained in GitHub repositories under the **VKS organization**.

**VKS GitHub Organization:**  
**[https://github.vrsn.com/vks](https://github.vrsn.com/vks)**

### Common repositories

- **[https://github.vrsn.com/vks/vks-ops-tools](https://github.vrsn.com/vks/vks-ops-tools)**

### Notes

- Ensure your **public SSH key** is uploaded to GitHub  
  (`Profile → Settings → SSH and GPG Keys`)
- Use the SSH public key generated on your **VDE**
- Clone repositories using **SSH**

---

## 5. VDE VKS Script Setup

Once you have access to your VDE and the required Git repositories, set up the VDE VKS scripts.

- Clone the **vks-ops-tools** repository
- Run the VDE setup scripts as documented in the repository:  
  **[VDE VKS Script Setup](https://github.vrsn.com/vks/vks-ops-tools/tree/main/vde_setup#setting-up-vde-vks-scripts)**

---

## 6. Kubernetes and Cluster Access

VKS Ops resources access Kubernetes clusters through:

- **Rancher (GUI)**
- **kubectl / CLI** from the VDE

Validate that you can query the cluster by following the steps below:

- **[Authenticate to a Cluster](../kubernetes/authenticate-to-cluster.md)**

---

## 7. Environments

The **Environments** page provides a centralized view of all VKS Kubernetes clusters and is the primary reference for locating cluster-specific URLs.

New team members should use this page to:

- Identify available workload and management clusters
- Determine cluster environment (**Prod**, **QA**, **Lab**)
- Access cluster-specific dashboards and tooling links, including:
  - Rancher
  - Calico Manager
  - Rook Manager
  - Grafana

### Access Notes

Rancher access must be performed from one of the following:

- The **VDE using noMachine** (GUI access), or
- Approved **Non-Prod or Prod TSG Windows jump systems**:  
  **[https://jump.vrsn.com/](https://jump.vrsn.com/)**

**Environments Page:**  
**[https://pages.github.vrsn.com/vks/vks-docs/environments/](https://pages.github.vrsn.com/vks/vks-docs/environments/)**
