h1. VKS Ops / SRE Onboarding Guide

This page outlines the required access, setup steps, and resources for engineers onboarding into the *VKS Ops / SRE* team.

It focuses on *what access is required* and *what must be set up*, while linking to authoritative documentation where detailed steps already exist.

---

h2. 1. Accesses

The following accesses are required for all VKS Ops / SRE resources.

* *FreeIPA (IPA):* New hire must be added to the appropriate VKS IPA group
* *GitHub:* New hire must be added to the *vks-ops* team under
https://github.vrsn.com/vks
* *Jira:* New hire must be added to the *VKS Support Jira project* with visibility to all relevant VKS projects
* *Netcool:* Access to the *VKS Ops Netcool filter* (requires a ticket to the MALT board)
* *Wiz:* Submit an access request to the *Wiz dashboard*

*Notes:*
* Jira, GitHub, Netcool, and Wiz use *VCorp credentials* (the same credentials used to connect to the corporate VPN)
* *FreeIPA (IPA) access is managed separately*

---

h2. 2. Request a VDE

A *Virtual Desktop Environment (VDE)* is required for all VKS operational work.

Use the following page to request a VDE:

* *Requesting a VDE*
(link to existing Confluence page)

---

h2. 3. Setting Up a Newly Issued VDE

Once you have received VDE access, set up both *VDE CLI* and *GUI* access.

---

h3. 3.1 Set Up VDE CLI Access

Set up the VDE CLI on your VDE. This provides command-line access required for VKS operational work.

*Guide:*
* *VDE CLI – Onboarding*
https://confluence.example.com/display/VKS/VDE+CLI+Onboarding

---

h3. 3.2 Request and Set Up GUI Access via noMachine on the VDE

Request and set up GUI access via noMachine on the VDE.

This enables access to Kubernetes-related dashboards and web interfaces such as Rancher, Rook Ceph, and Calico.

*Guide:*
* *VDE – GUI Access via noMachine*
https://confluence.example.com/display/VKS/VDE+Access+via+noMachine

---

h2. 4. Git Repository Access

VKS operational tooling and automation are maintained in GitHub repositories under the VKS organization.

*VKS GitHub Organization:*
https://github.vrsn.com/vks

*Common repositories:*
* https://github.vrsn.com/vks/vks-ops-tools

*Notes:*
* Ensure your *public SSH key* is uploaded to GitHub
* Clone repositories using SSH

---

h2. 5. VDE VKS Script Setup

Once you have access to your VDE and the required Git repositories, set up the VDE VKS scripts.

* Clone the *vks-ops-tools* repository
* Run the VDE setup scripts as documented in the repository

---

h2. 6. Kubernetes and Cluster Access

VKS Ops resources access Kubernetes clusters through:

* *Rancher (GUI)*
* *kubectl / CLI* from the VDE

---

h2. 7. Environments

The *Environments* page provides a centralized view of all VKS Kubernetes clusters and is the primary reference for locating cluster-specific URLs.

New team members should use this page to:
* Identify available workload and management clusters
* Determine cluster environment (Prod, QA, Lab)
* Access cluster-specific dashboards and tooling links, including:
** Rancher
** Calico Manager
** Rook Manager
** Grafana
** Cluster Repository
** NeuVector
* Quickly locate the correct URLs for a given cluster without searching multiple systems

*Access Notes:*
* *Rancher access* must be performed from:
** The VDE using *noMachine (GUI access)*, or
** Approved *Non-Prod or Prod TSG Windows jump systems*

*Environments Page:*
