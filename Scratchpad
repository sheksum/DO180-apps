Performance Goal

Own and improve core Linux, identity, and platform infrastructure, while supporting teams during major outages and complex incidents.

Describe the actions taken to support the Goal

Satellite
Expanded Red Hat Satellite by adding and maintaining additional products so developers and build systems can pull required packages from internal repositories instead of downloading directly from the internet. This reduced security exposure and improved consistency across environments.

Landscape
Set up and standardized Landscape profiles and distributed them across all managed systems, enabling package installs and updates to be sourced entirely from on-prem infrastructure with no dependency on internet proxying.

Automation
Automated recurring operational tasks to reduce manual effort and improve consistency across systems. This included streamlining patching, configuration changes, and platform setup so common actions could be executed reliably and repeatedly.

Centralized sudo and access management
Centralized sudo management and put processes in place to discourage the use of shared logins. Most users now perform tasks as themselves, resulting in significant improvement in accountability, auditability, and day-to-day access hygiene.

AI Kubernetes environment
Built and stood up a self-contained AI-enabled Kubernetes environment using RKE2 and NVIDIA GPU Operator to support GPU-accelerated workloads. Owned the platform end-to-end, including storage provisioning, GPU drivers, cluster setup, and validation.

Root CA trust automation
Ensured all VMs trusted the Calix Root CA by automating certificate trust configuration and successfully handing off the process to a junior team member for broader rollout.

Proxy hardening
Hardened proxy systems, including plnproxy, from a security standpoint to improve overall security posture and reduce operational risk.

Container image registry
Built an internal container image registry so workloads could pull images from on-prem systems. All Tabnine container images are now sourced internally.

Centralized logging and retention
Set up centralized logging and log retention for identity-related systems and integrated them with Microsoft Sentinel.

Cluster management and monitoring
Deployed the cluster-management UI and monitoring stack for AI-enabled Kubernetes clusters to improve visibility and operational control.

Secrets management
Set up HashiCorp Vault and the External Secrets Operator so secrets can be securely stored and consumed by platforms and applications.

Vulnerability mitigation
Performed vulnerability mitigation across systems to address security findings and reduce exposure.

IPA and FortiDLP integration
Integrated IPA LDAP with FortiDLP by developing automation to pull user information from IPA, push it into FortiDLP, and schedule the process via cron.

Observability
Onboarded all build systems into Grafana, including tsfarm and selected ont-sim systems, and automated the onboarding process to improve monitoring, visibility, and operational awareness across critical build and simulation infrastructure.

Patching
Performed quarterly patching for user and build systems and automated the process. Patching for Landscape-managed systems is now a click-of-a-button workflow, and systems outside Landscape still source updates from on-prem repositories, avoiding heavy reliance on the Squid proxy.

Developer tooling
Set up and configured ModelSim DE 2020.2, a simulation tool used by Mike Roffo’s team. Ensured it was properly installed and integrated into the Linux environment, and resolved dependency and environment issues so engineers could reliably simulate and debug designs without manual workarounds or repeated setup problems.

Logging stability
Moved logging to dedicated storage and configured log rotation on IPA masters. Set up dedicated /var/log storage on all build systems to resolve recurring issues where disks filled up and caused application failures and user access problems.

Build reliability
Fixed a recurring builder SSH key mismatch issue that previously prevented developers from running builds as the builder account.

Standardized automation account
Set up a deploy break-glass and automation account across all systems to eliminate inconsistent local users (e.g., calix, calix_admin, smx), making automation reliable and secure across environments.

Hiring support
Helped conduct technical interviews to identify and bring in strong candidates for the team.

Linux escalation
Served as the final point of escalation for complex Linux-related issues and joined major outage calls to troubleshoot and restore service.




Summary

This review cycle, I focused on strengthening core Linux, identity, and platform infrastructure while reducing operational risk and manual effort. I delivered several foundational improvements, including internal package management through Satellite and Landscape, automated patching, centralized access controls, and improved logging, monitoring, and observability across critical systems.

I also built and supported key platforms, including a self-contained AI-enabled Kubernetes environment with GPU support, an internal container image registry, centralized secrets management, and standardized automation accounts to enable reliable operations at scale. Alongside platform delivery, I addressed long-standing reliability issues, hardened proxy systems, mitigated vulnerabilities, and automated processes that previously required significant manual effort.

Operationally, I served as a point of escalation for complex Linux issues and actively supported teams during major outages and incidents. I also contributed to team growth by helping with technical interviews and ensuring knowledge was documented and handed off where appropriate. Overall, my work this cycle focused on turning manual or fragile systems into stable, secure, and repeatable platforms that better support both developers and operations.
