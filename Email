Hey Team,

Has anyone encountered login issues on any systems today? Just confirming authentication is functioning as expected.

Since there haven’t been any user reports of login failures, it appears we’re in the clear from an authentication standpoint.

I’ve removed the IPA master from the topology and configured replication agreements from the remaining replicas. Everything looks stable so far, but I’ll continue monitoring and digging into the behavior.
