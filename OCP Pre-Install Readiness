OpenShift Platform Readiness – Pre-Install Dependencies
Allocate Network CIDRs for OpenShift Platform & Workloads

Description
Allocate and document network CIDRs required for the OpenShift platform, including infrastructure nodes, application/workload networks, and ingress/load balancer VIPs.
This task focuses on address allocation only, not firewall or policy implementation.

Key Outcomes

CIDRs allocated for platform, workloads, and ingress

CIDRs documented and approved

No overlap with existing environments

Confirm Network Reachability for OpenShift Dependencies

Description
Confirm that the OpenShift platform CIDRs can reach required enterprise services at a high level.
This task documents expected network flows (no ports) to align with the network team ahead of installation.

Dependencies Include

API and ingress load balancers

NetApp storage

On-prem container registry

Identity provider (FreeIPA / IdM)

HashiCorp Vault

Centralized logging (Graylog)

Key Outcomes

High-level reachability confirmed

Expected network flows documented

Network team alignment achieved

Assess On-Prem Container Registry Using Existing Cluster

Description
Assess the existing on-prem container registry using the current AI-enabled Kubernetes (RKE2) cluster to ensure it can support a disconnected OpenShift environment.
This includes evaluating image push/pull workflows, authentication/TLS, and available image vulnerability scanning or supported integrations.

Key Outcomes

Image push and pull validated from RKE2

TLS and authentication confirmed

Image scanning capability or integration path identified

Registry suitability for disconnected OpenShift documented

HashiCorp Vault Integration Readiness (GitOps)

Description
Confirm HashiCorp Vault integration readiness using a GitOps-driven workflow on the existing on-prem AI-enabled Kubernetes (RKE2) cluster.
The goal is to validate a reusable secrets management pattern for OpenShift.

Key Outcomes

Kubernetes authentication to Vault validated

Secrets consumed by workloads without manual handling

Git-managed manifests reference Vault-backed secrets

Reusable integration pattern documented

Set Up and Exercise GitOps Tooling

Description
Set up an initial Git repository and exercise GitOps workflows using FluxCD on the existing cluster to confirm readiness for OpenShift.

Key Outcomes

Git repository created and accessible

FluxCD installed and healthy on RKE2

Git-driven changes successfully reconciled

GitOps pattern validated for reuse

Review Jenkins Readiness for OpenShift Workflows

Description
Review whether existing Jenkins systems can support OpenShift-related workflows (image builds, GitOps triggers, automation), or if a dedicated Jenkins instance is required.

Key Outcomes

Existing Jenkins capabilities assessed

Reuse vs dedicated Jenkins decision documented

Risks and follow-up actions identified

Check Identity Provider Readiness (FreeIPA / IdM)

Description
Check that the existing FreeIPA / IdM environment is ready to integrate with OpenShift for authentication and RBAC.
This will be validated by integrating FreeIPA / IdM with the existing on-prem AI-enabled Kubernetes (RKE2) cluster to confirm the authentication and group-mapping approach.

Key Outcomes

Authentication against IdM validated

Group-to-role mapping confirmed

Required certificates and trust relationships identified

Integration pattern documented for OpenShift

Confirm Centralized Logging Pattern for OpenShift

Description
Confirm that centralized logging is enabled and working on the current on-prem AI-enabled Kubernetes cluster, and determine whether the same logging approach can be reused for OpenShift.

Key Outcomes

Logs successfully forwarded from RKE2 workloads

Graylog connectivity and assumptions confirmed

Logging integration pattern documented for OpenShift
