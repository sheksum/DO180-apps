Restart Controller Pods
Restart all cappy controller pods to trigger the reconciliation process and clear the paused cluster
state.
Issue Description
Deployment scale-down fails during an image update.
Static workers on all machines are attempting a scale-down but are not succeeding.
Manual deletion of the machine object does not work, leaving the system hung.
The cluster remains in a paused state despite attempts to unpause.
Diagnostics & Cause
The upgrade operation to update the image was initiated while the cluster was paused.
The machine object still shows the cluster spec as paused (pause status true).
Finalizers on machine objects appear to block deletion.
The reconciliation process is not registering the unpaused state as expected.
Remediation & Next Steps
Consider restarting all cappy controller pods to trigger reconciliation.
Explore remediation via the cluster API and possibly force delete machine objects by editing finalizers.
Further investigation is needed to ensure the cluster unpauses properly without manual intervention.
