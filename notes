Opener
"Thanks for setting up this call, Eric. I just wanted to share a few observations — some from my own experience and some I’ve heard from others — so we can figure out how to make the team stronger and work better together. I think having an open conversation about it will help us find ways to address these things and improve how we operate."
1. Role clarity
"One thing I’ve noticed is that the line between operations work and development work sometimes gets blurred. For example, when someone from our team jumps into developer tasks, it can make it seem like everyone should be doing the same — and if they don’t, it looks inconsistent. I think setting clearer boundaries on who does what would help us stay focused and aligned."
2. Communication & respect
"Another thing is how we communicate during calls. There are times when the tone can come off as dismissive or belittling, especially if someone is more experienced in a certain area. I’ve seen that make people hold back from speaking up, which isn’t good for the team. It might help if we keep the conversations constructive so everyone feels comfortable contributing."
3. Change management
"We’ve also had a lot of changes being rolled out back-to-back. While change is part of the job, it gets tricky when there’s not enough notice or coordination. It puts extra pressure on ops and increases the chance for mistakes. I think we could benefit from a stronger change management process so we balance speed with stability."
4. Team mindset
"At times, it feels like the team operates more as individuals than as one unit. There’s a lot of ‘I’ and not as much ‘we.’ I think we’d be stronger if we worked more collaboratively, shared knowledge, and leveraged everyone’s strengths instead of working in silos."
5. Right roles for success
"One thing I’ve come to realize is that someone can be very strong technically but not necessarily as strong in managing people. That’s worth considering when we’re assigning responsibilities — making sure roles fit both the technical skills and the people side so everyone’s set up to succeed."
Closer
"Those are the main things I wanted to bring up. I’d like to hear your thoughts as well, and maybe we can figure out some practical steps to move forward."
