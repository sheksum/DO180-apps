Update on FortiDLP LDAP Sync Issue

Followed Fortinet's documentation to configure fortiDLP-ldap-sync for user synchronization with IPA.
Used the admin credentials that normally allow successful IPA binding, but encountered an "Invalid Credentials" error (LDAP Result Code 49).
Confirmed that the credentials are correct and verified connectivity to the LDAP server.
Logs indicate an LDAP connection failure, preventing user synchronization.
Opened ticket 7589 with the vendor for further investigation.
Next Steps: Awaiting vendor response and troubleshooting guidance.
