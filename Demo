During this period, one of the areas I worked on was keeping our DNS and registry-related services stable and current. I continued managing the SSL certificate renewals across all Rancher clusters, renewed the Rancher API key to avoid integration issues, and completed the wildcard certificate updates across all regions.

I also updated the IPA CA signing certificates in production and supported the Kyverno onboarding to help tighten policy enforcement. In addition to that, I spent time refining parts of our permission model to improve how QoS boundaries are applied.

These were just a few of the technical areas I handled during the cycle, but overall the goal was to keep things running smoothly, reduce risk, and strengthen some of the gaps we identified along the way.

Throughout this cycle, I continued supporting several critical infrastructure services across our environments. This included customer engagement, namespace deployments, IP pool updates, and application onboarding — while also improving support documentation to enhance usability and overall platform experience.

In addition to the ongoing work, I contributed to multiple key infrastructure initiatives, including shutting down VKS OSTCK undercloud components across all QA and PROD regions, updating resolv.conf for all VKS and Kubernetes nodes to match the new DC-specific addressing, updating messaging keytabs across OpenStack regions, and modifying DNS records, Calico NetworkSets, and Rancher configurations following the IPA server decommissioning in SPE. I also completed the VKS PROD hypervisor conversion to workload cluster workers and supported several DNS and system-level updates across our VKS platform.

I handled several cluster-level improvements across our production regions, including enabling the Typha load balancer endpoint for non-cluster nodes, deploying CNPG 1.27.0 to address issues where the operator was not reliably promoting the designated primary DB instance to a replica during node drains for patching, causing failovers to get stuck, updating Ironic in management for the new NTP source, and performing upgrades across the core infrastructure stack — including Calico, Rancher, Envoy, and the various CAPI components — to keep the clusters current and stable. I corrected Ceph host counts to match the actual number of static workers, refined alerts where needed, and addressed several configuration mismatches observed across clusters.

To name but a few automation efforts this cycle, I automated the checks for BGP peering status across all nodes, removing repetitive manual work and giving us a faster way to confirm cluster health after upgrades or networking changes. I also built a script to identify lingering IP pools that were no longer in use — whether they were left behind after a namespace was deleted or when customers moved to larger IP blocks and the original allocation wasn’t cleaned up. This helped us remove unused ranges and keep capacity planning accurate.

As part of the VKS work, I helped decommission legacy VKS storage hardware (ASH3), created new Designate zones for the VKS8 management and workload clusters and worked with the MALT team to update the upstream records. I also created DNS records for the QA2 MGMT ingress and generated the OOB DNS records required for the QA2 buildout. In addition to this, I rebuilt the KVA3 region to VKS8. Separately, I also worked with Matt to stand up the VSCC-ILG cluster and get it fully operational.

Alongside the technical work, I ensured every change and maintenance activity was fully documented in Jira/ServiceNow with clear details and validation notes, which helps support internal audits and maintain our compliance standards.


section 3 

Over the year, I focused on improving the day-to-day experience for our internal customers. A big part of this was updating and expanding our support documentation so the steps for onboarding, namespace creation, IP allocations, Day-2 operations, and general troubleshooting are clearer and easier to follow. This reduced confusion, cut down on back-and-forth, and helped make our processes more consistent.

I also fine-tuned a number of alerts across the platform to remove noise and highlight the conditions that actually matter operationally. This improved our signal-to-noise ratio and made day-to-day work more productive.

Outside of documentation and alerting, I supported several activities such as application onboarding and general platform support. Much of this work helped smooth out common friction points and made it easier for teams to adopt and operate on the VKS platform.
