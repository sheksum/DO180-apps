Task 6 — Ingress/LB → March 7
Recommending MetalLB L2 mode — native OpenShift operator, no external dependency, no BGP or router coordination needed. Define IP address pools from VLAN 1510 subnet. Configure DNS wildcard records, TLS certificates, validate external access. Depends on Task 14 (TLS) completing first. F5 is an option if corporate requires it but adds dependency on network team. Need to confirm with Brian if there’s a corporate standard before committing.
	∙	Task 7 — Auth/RBAC → March 7
Configure IPA as LDAP identity provider. Define RBAC for admin/dev/ops roles. Create dev/test/prod namespaces. Apply quotas, limits, network policies. Okta as secondary IdP is pending manager decision but does not block phase 1.
	∙	Task 8 — GPU Operator → Feb 23
90% done. Only remaining item is applying taints/tolerations (nvidia.com/gpu=true:NoSchedule) to gpu01/gpu02 so non-GPU workloads don’t schedule on GPU nodes. NFD, GPU Operator, ClusterPolicy, and nvidia-smi validation are all complete.
	∙	Task 9 — GitOps → Feb 28
50% done. ArgoCD installed and connected to Bitbucket via SSH deploy key. App-of-Apps root application deployed. Remaining: configure ArgoCD RBAC, create Application manifests per folder (nmstate, trident, machineconfigs) to enable drift protection, validate sync and rollback.
	∙	Task 10 — Backup/DR → March 12
Install OADP (Velero). Configure backup storage location. Define backup schedules. Configure etcd backup automation. Test restore of sample namespace.
	∙	Task 11 — E2E Validation → March 17
Deploy sample AI workload using GPU + NetApp storage. Validate deployment via GitOps. Validate dev/test/prod namespace isolation. Validate backup and restore. Final gate before shakeout — needs Tasks 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 16 complete.
	∙	Task 12 — Monitoring → March 20
Hardening phase. Configure persistent storage for monitoring stack. Define retention policies. Create custom alert rules. Build dashboards for GPU utilization, storage, and cluster health.
	∙	Task 13 — Logging → March 20
Hardening phase. Deploy logging stack. Configure persistent storage. Define retention policies. Configure log forwarding.
	∙	Task 14 — TLS / Vault PKI → Feb 25
90% done. Full PKI chain working with self-signed root CA. Remaining: replace default certs on API, console, and ingress routes using vault-issuer. Calix CA swap pending Brian/IT signing the intermediate CSR — not blocking, self-signed is functional.
	∙	Task 15 — NetBox IPAM → March 14 (Vinoth)
Assigned to Vinoth. Data gathered for VLANs, subnets, node IPs, NetApp details. Needs to be entered into NetBox. Rack layouts and switch port mappings still open — requires coordination with Chetan/Gowtham.
	∙	Task 16 — AI Platform Services → March 14
Deploy MinIO (S3 object storage, NetApp backed), Milvus (vector database), CNPG (PostgreSQL). ML platform, notebooks, and model serving TBD — waiting on Sulabh for GCP stack details (expected Friday).
	∙	GPU NIC Migration → March 4
Blocked on Chetan completing LACP LAG + VLAN config on Leaf-5/6 for Mellanox ports. Once switch side is done: create NMState NNCPs for GPU workers with LACP bond + VLAN subinterfaces, migrate management from Broadcom 1G to Mellanox 100G bond. Unblocks direct storage VLAN access for GPU workers and allows relaxing the registry master-only constraint.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
