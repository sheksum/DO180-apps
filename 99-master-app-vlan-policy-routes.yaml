Hey Awanish — got all your pods running in pai-dev tonight. Here's what I found and fixed, you'll need to make these permanent in your Helm charts before your next deploy:

**1. agent-gateway + internal-agentmesh-agent-gateway-service — both crash-looping**
Both were failing on PostgreSQL SSL. agent-gateway had PGSSLMODE=require hardcoded in the deployment env, and internal-agentmesh didn't have it set at all so asyncpg defaulted to looking for client certs at /home/appuser/.postgresql/postgresql.key. Your PostgreSQL instance has ssl=off so require will never work anyway. I set PGSSLMODE=disable on both — update your charts to match.

**2. fileparser — stuck at 0 pods**
Two issues:
- Missing ServiceAccount — chart references `internal-datapipeline-rag-fileparser-service` SA but doesn't create it. I created it manually, add it to your chart.
- Broken entrypoint — image uses `uv run parser-service` but the binary is at /app/.venv/bin/parser-service, not in PATH. I overrode the command to call the venv binary directly. Fix either the Dockerfile entrypoint or add `command: ["/app/.venv/bin/parser-service"]` to the chart.

**3. Also spotted:**
- Typo in the internal-agentmesh configmap: POSTGRES_DB_URL has `test_dB` (capital B), POSTGRES_ASYNC_DB_URL has `test_db`. That'll bite you. Quick fix:
```
oc get configmap internal-agentmesh-agent-gateway-service -n pai-dev -o json | sed 's/test_dB/test_db/g' | oc apply -f -
```
- DB creds are plaintext in the configmap — when you're ready we can move those to Vault, the ESO pipeline is working.

After you update the charts, verify with:
```
oc get pods -n pai-dev
```
All 5 should show Running with 0 restarts.

All pods are Running now. Let me know if you have questions.
