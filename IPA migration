Summary

Migrate the primary Red Hat Identity Management (IPA/IdM) master from the Petaluma datacenter to Plano, including OS upgrade from RHEL8 to RHEL9, hostname/IP changes, and client repointing.

⸻

Description

As part of the Petaluma datacenter shutdown and NetApp upgrade activities, we need to migrate the primary Red Hat Identity (IPA/IdM) environment out of Petaluma and establish a new primary IPA master in Plano.

This effort will involve building a new IPA master on RHEL9, migrating services and replication, updating hostnames and IPs, and repointing client systems. Client-side SSSD configurations will need to be cleaned up to ensure systems only reference the correct Plano IPA endpoints post-cutover.

Currently, IPA clients are configured to communicate with both the Petaluma IPA master and pln-petipareplica as part of redundancy. This will need to be corrected during the migration.

This work is critical to fully decommission Petaluma-based identity services.

⸻

Scope
	•	Build new IPA master in Plano on RHEL9
	•	Establish IPA replication and validate health
	•	Migrate primary IPA role from Petaluma to Plano
	•	Update hostnames and IP addresses
	•	Update / clean up SSSD configurations on client systems
	•	Validate authentication, sudo, HBAC, and DNS post-migration
	•	Decommission Petaluma IPA master after successful cutover

⸻

Out of Scope
	•	Application-level auth changes
	•	Non-IPA identity systems

⸻

Proposed Approach (High-Level)
	1.	Provision new RHEL9 IPA master in Plano
	2.	Configure IPA replication with existing environment
	3.	Validate replication and directory health
	4.	Promote Plano IPA master as primary
	5.	Update client configurations and remove Petaluma references
	6.	Perform validation testing (login, sudo, HBAC)
	7.	Decommission Petaluma IPA master

⸻

Dependencies
	•	Plano infrastructure availability
	•	Maintenance window approval for client repointing
	•	Coordination with Tools / Infra teams

⸻

Risks
	•	Authentication outages if clients are not properly repointed
	•	Incomplete cleanup of SSSD configs
	•	DNS or certificate issues during cutover

⸻

Success Criteria
	•	All IPA services running from Plano
	•	Clients authenticate successfully without Petaluma dependencies
	•	Petaluma IPA master fully decommissioned
	•	No authentication or sudo regressions reported

Stakeholders
	•	Tools & Services
	•	Infrastructure
	•	Security
