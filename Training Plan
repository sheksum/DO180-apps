h1. NOC Training Plan – Kubernetes (VKS)

h2. Purpose and Context

The Verisign Kubernetes Service (VKS) is a full-featured Kubernetes platform built on open-source components and managed via Rancher, designed to operate in a cloud-native enterprise environment.

As part of an operational handoff, a defined set of basic operational responsibilities will be transitioned to the NOC. To safely and effectively support these responsibilities, the NOC must develop a foundational understanding of Kubernetes concepts as they apply specifically to VKS.

*This training plan outlines the minimum Kubernetes knowledge needed for the NOC to effectively support the VKS platform.* The focus is on operational awareness, alert triage, and proper escalation — not platform engineering.

h2. Training Principles and Scope

* This training is intended to enable operational support, not platform engineering.
* The NOC is not expected to design, deploy, or modify Kubernetes applications or platform components.
* All NOC actions must be covered by documented runbooks and approved procedures.
* Any activity outside documented scope must be escalated.

h2. Ownership

*VKSOps / AVID retains ownership of:*
* Platform architecture and design
* Cluster configuration and upgrades
* Lifecycle management
* Complex platform-level incident resolution

The NOC is responsible for monitoring, first-level triage, and escalation only.

h2. Training Structure Overview

|| Training Area || Objective ||
| Kubernetes Fundamentals | Understand what VKS is built on |
| Kubernetes Operations | Safely triage and support issues |

h2. Training Access Note

Some of the training materials referenced in this plan are hosted on Pluralsight and require an active subscription.  
If you do not currently have access, please reach out to *AI-Central@verisign.com* for assistance.

h2. Kubernetes Beginner Training Path

This training path introduces core Kubernetes concepts as they apply to the Verisign Kubernetes Service (VKS). Since VKS exposes standard Kubernetes behavior and alerts, a basic working knowledge of Kubernetes is necessary to monitor the platform and follow operational runbooks. The focus is on operational behavior within VKS, not application development or platform engineering.

h3. Training Content

|| Title || Type ||
| Kubernetes Crash Course for Absolute Beginners | Video |
| Introduction to Kubernetes | Course |

h2. Operations Training Path

This training path builds on the Kubernetes beginner material and focuses on day-to-day operational support of workloads running on VKS. *It focuses on day-to-day triage, identifying common Kubernetes issues, and determining when escalation to VKSOps is required.*

|| Title || Type ||
| Hands-On Kubernetes Troubleshooting | Course |

h2. Optional Hands-On Learning (Kind Cluster)

*To get additional hands-on exposure after completing the training*, an optional local Kubernetes environment can be used for experimentation and learning.

The *kind (Kubernetes in Docker)* project provides a lightweight, self-contained Kubernetes cluster that runs locally and allows users to interact with core Kubernetes objects in a safe, isolated environment.

This option is intended for learning and familiarity only and is not required for NOC operational readiness.

h3. Scope and Guardrails

* The kind cluster is local and standalone
* It does not represent VKS scale, integrations, or production behavior
* No access to VKS or shared environments is required
* Usage is optional and self-directed

h3. Reference

* Internal *kind-cluster repository*  
  Provides instructions and automation for deploying a local kind cluster, including prerequisites, setup steps, and example workflows.

h2. VKS Environment and Reference Material

The following materials provide additional context for operating within the VKS environment and are intended to complement the training paths above.

* *VKS Environment Overview Page*  
  Central reference containing VKS environment URLs, dashboards, ingress endpoints, and supporting services.
* VKS User Guide
* VKS Operations Guide
* Kubectl Cheatsheet
* VKS Technical Architecture & Design Document (TADD) – Reference Only

These materials are provided for visibility and reference. Mastery of platform architecture is not expected of the NOC.

h2. Next Steps

Once the training paths have been completed, the following steps will be taken to prepare the NOC for operational support of the VKS platform:

* Review the *VKS Environment Overview Page* with the NOC and conduct guided walkthrough sessions as needed to validate access and familiarity
* Validate NOC access to required tools, dashboards, and read-only views
* Review operational runbooks and escalation procedures
* Confirm expectations around monitoring, triage, and escalation responsibilities
* Address any access gaps or questions prior to full operational handoff
