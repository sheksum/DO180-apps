I’ve validated the current RBAC configuration for NOC users in Rancher and synced up with Tinh from the NOC to directly test access.

NOC users can successfully access Rancher and interact with the workload clusters. Application-level access is working as expected. They are able to manage pods (including deletes) and perform Flux/GitOps operations such as reconciliations without issue.

The permissions currently granted via the GlobalRole VKS NOC Admin are largely application-level and GitOps-focused. This includes access to Flux resources (GitRepositories, HelmReleases, Kustomizations, image automation resources), as well as standard workload resources such as Deployments, StatefulSets, Services, Ingresses, ConfigMaps, Secrets, Jobs, and HPAs.

Where the gap exists is at the cluster and infrastructure layer. NOC users:
	•	Cannot see or access the management (local) cluster in Rancher
	•	Cannot query the Kubernetes API directly using kubectl
	•	Do not have permissions to view nodes
	•	Do not have permissions to perform node-level operations such as draining nodes

Overall, workload access mostly looks right, but cluster-level and infrastructure-level permissions are missing. I’ll open a ticket with AVID to request the appropriate RBAC updates so the required access can be added.
