Update on Docker Registry Setup

Deployed a private Docker registry (registry:2) with TLS enabled using signed certificates.
Integrated the [Konradkleine] Docker Registry Frontend UI and made it accessible via HTTPS using an nginx reverse proxy container.
Successfully mirrored Docker Hub by enabling proxy caching (REGISTRY_PROXY_REMOTEURL) â€” this allows caching of images locally.
Restricted all client systems from pulling images directly from Docker Hub (registry-1.docker.io) using firewall rules and daemon config enforcement.
Verified image pulls (e.g., nginx, httpd) are served from our internal registry and UI reflects available images.
SSL validation confirmed via curl and browser.
Nginx, UI, and registry services are containerized and managed via docker-compose.
