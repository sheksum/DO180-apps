PXE Boot Automation Progress Update
Accomplishments:

PXE Boot Server Configuration
Configured DHCP server (dhcpd.conf) to support PXE boot.
Defined UEFI and Legacy BIOS boot paths.
Resolved issues related to multiple DHCP servers offering leases.
TFTP and Bootloader Setup
Verified that the TFTP server is running and serving files.
Confirmed that the client successfully downloads shimx64.efi, grubx64.efi, and grub.cfg.
PXE Boot Menu Appears
The PXE boot menu is successfully displayed.
grub.cfg correctly points to vmlinuz and initrd.img.
Kernel and Initrd Downloads
Captured network traffic showing that vmlinuz and initrd.img are being requested and downloaded.
Kickstart Configuration
Kickstart file (ks.cfg) is accessible via HTTP.
Installation starts, but prompts for manual user input, which is not desired.
Modified Kickstart settings to ensure an unattended installation.
Current Challenge: Blank Screen After Boot Menu

Issue: After selecting the boot option from the PXE menu, the screen goes blank instead of proceeding with the installation.
Possible Causes:
GRUB misconfiguration: Kernel parameters may need debugging flags (inst.debug rd.debug inst.text).
Display Issues: The installer may be attempting a graphical interface that isn't displaying properly.
Missing Kernel or Initrd: The client may not be properly loading vmlinuz or initrd.img.
Kickstart Not Being Processed: If ks.cfg is missing, the installer may be waiting for manual input.
Next Steps for Investigation

Enable Debugging in GRUB
Update /var/lib/tftpboot/EFI/BOOT/grub.cfg:
linuxefi /EFI/BOOT/vmlinuz inst.repo=http://10.168.0.58/repo inst.ks=http://10.168.0.58/ks.cfg console=ttyS0,115200n8 inst.text inst.debug rd.debug rd.shell
initrdefi /EFI/BOOT/initrd.img
Check Logs on PXE Client
Press Ctrl+Alt+F2 after the blank screen to check logs.
Run:
dmesg | tail -50
journalctl -xe
Validate Kernel and Initrd Availability
Ensure both files exist on the TFTP server:
ls -lh /var/lib/tftpboot/EFI/BOOT/
If missing, copy from RHEL installation media.
Confirm Kickstart is Applied Automatically
Verify that ks.cfg is available:
curl -v http://10.168.0.58/ks.cfg
If Kickstart isn’t working, the installer may prompt for manual setup.
Monitor Network Traffic
Capture logs to see if the installer is fetching all required files:
tcpdump -i any port 67 or port 68 or port 69 -vvv
Summary
✅ PXE Boot Server is configured
✅ TFTP and DHCP are working
✅ Boot menu appears
✅ Kernel and Initrd are being downloaded
⚠️ Screen goes blank after menu selection
⚠️ Installation requires manual input instead of running unattended

Current Focus: Debugging the blank screen and ensuring fully automated installation.
