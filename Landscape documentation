üõ†Ô∏è Setting Up Your Deploy Key

1. Retrieve the Private Key
Open LastPass and locate the saved deploy private key.
Copy the entire key, ensuring it includes:
-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
...
-----END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
2. Create the Key File
vi ~/.ssh/deploy_key
Paste the key and save the file.
3. Set File Permissions
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/deploy_key
4. Add the Key to Your Session
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/deploy_key
5. Auto-load the Key on Login
Edit your ~/.bash_profile or ~/.bashrc:

# ~/.bash_profile
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/deploy_key
Then reload:

source ~/.bash_profile
6. Test SSH Access
ssh deploy@<hostname>
‚ö†Ô∏è If it fails, it may be because:
The deploy user does not exist on the target system, or
The public key is missing from /opt/home/deploy/.ssh/authorized_keys.
üë§ Setting Up the deploy User Remotely

1. Clone the Git Repo
git clone http://stash.calix.local/scm/hsuma/infra-dev.git
cd infra-dev
2. Run the Ansible Playbook
ansible-playbook deploy-user-setup.yml -i <inventory_file>
Replace <inventory_file> with the path to your Ansible inventory.
Let me know if you want this as a downloadable .txt or .md for backup.
