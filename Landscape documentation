Ubuntu Landscape – Centralized Ubuntu Systems Management

Overview
Landscape is Canonical's centralized systems management solution for Ubuntu. It provides administrators with a secure, web-based dashboard for managing thousands of systems in production and development environments. Landscape simplifies patching, automation, compliance, reporting, and user access control.

What is Landscape?

Canonical’s management platform for Ubuntu infrastructure

Web-based interface for overseeing thousands of systems

Enables patching, package updates, compliance reporting, and automation

Think of it as "Red Hat Satellite for Ubuntu".

Key Features

System inventory and registration overview

Live metrics: memory, disk, CPU usage

Update/package management

Script execution across systems

Tagging, user/group management

Role-based access control and audit logging

Architecture Overview
This diagram illustrates how components of Landscape interact:

Clients run the landscape-client service, reporting to the Landscape Server.

The server handles requests and task execution via the job handler and message server.

All data is persisted in the PostgreSQL backend, and communication happens securely over HTTPS.

Admins interact via the Apache web UI, issuing commands and reviewing dashboards.
