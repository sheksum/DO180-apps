I'm happy to assist with this request. Just to provide a bit of context—our approach to granting sudo access has recently changed. We no longer assign sudo privileges on a per-system basis. Additionally, the use of shared login accounts (such as cafetest) is being discouraged, as shared logins make it difficult to track changes and maintain accountability.

Sudo access is now centrally managed through IPA. If your team already has an existing IPA group, I’ll add you to it. If not, I’ll create a new group, define the appropriate sudo rules, and link them to the group—members automatically inherit the permissions once added.

If your team does not yet have an IPA group, please provide the following information so I can create one:

Team name within the organization
List of members who should be included
Hosts the team owns or is responsible for
Type of sudo privileges required (e.g., full access, limited commands, etc.)
While shared logins are discouraged, we can provide a bot account for automation purposes if needed. This bot account won’t have a login shell and is not meant for interactive use. All administrative actions should now be performed under your individual account.

Let me know how you'd like to proceed.
