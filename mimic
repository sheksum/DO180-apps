Subject: [Action Required] goa-daemon Bug Causing Log Spam, Disk Space Consumption, and Resource Usage

Hi team,

We recently observed an issue on the following GNOME-based systems where excessive log spam from goa-daemon was causing the root filesystem to fill up:

plnx-tsfarm01.caal.dev
plnx-tsfarm02.caal.dev
cf-u22-vshah
This behavior stems from a known bug in GNOME Online Accounts (goa-daemon), where the daemon continuously logs errors due to invalid or missing account entries.

If not addressed, this can lead to:

Disk space consumption (especially in /var/log)
Unnecessary or excessive system resource usage (CPU, memory)
Potential system instability over time
Fix:
A permanent workaround has been documented in Confluence:

If you notice similar log spam or symptoms on other GNOME-based systems, please apply the documented fix.
