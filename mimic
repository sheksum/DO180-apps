From what I’ve seen so far, most candidates are lacking in hands-on troubleshooting and foundational system knowledge. Many can talk about tools like Docker, Ansible, or Kubernetes, but struggle to explain how they’ve actually used them in practice.

A lot of the responses also feel AI-assisted — and it becomes obvious when they can’t handle follow-up questions or go deeper into their own examples. Once you ask them how they configured something or why they chose a certain approach, that’s where most stumble.

To help with screening, here’s a simple framework you can use to gauge technical depth early on, even if you’re not technical yourself. The idea is to ask open-ended, practical questions that reveal whether they truly understand what they’re describing.

1. Start With Foundational Questions

Ask scenario-based questions to see how they think through real-world issues.
Examples:

“How would you troubleshoot a performance issue on a Linux system?”

“How do you patch systems? Let’s say a system fails to come back up after patching — what could be the issue and how would you fix it?”

You’re not judging correctness — just listen for logical flow and confidence. Strong candidates will explain their reasoning clearly and naturally reference commands, tools, or logs.

2. Drill Into Their Resume

If they list specific tools, use follow-ups to test real understanding:

If they mention Docker or Kubernetes:

“Can you tell me the difference between Docker and Kubernetes?”
“Can you describe a project where you deployed or managed containers?”

If they mention Ansible:

“What types of automation did you build with it?”

Those who’ve truly worked with these tools will explain the process step-by-step. Those who haven’t tend to stay vague or inconsistent.

3. Recommend a 30-Minute Video Call

I’d recommend setting up a short 30-minute video call with each candidate instead of relying on chat or phone screens.
Seeing how they communicate and explain themselves in real time is one of the fastest ways to identify who’s genuinely confident versus who’s reading from notes or using AI help.

From experience, this approach has consistently helped us identify the right candidates early and save time for the technical team.
