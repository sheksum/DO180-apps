This issue is caused by a known bug in goa-daemon, a background component of GNOME Online Accounts. The daemon attempts to load invalid or incomplete online account configurations (e.g., entries with missing provider types), which triggers repeated error messages in system logs.

GNOME Online Accounts is designed to integrate services like Google, Microsoft, and Facebook into the GNOME desktop environment. However, if no valid accounts are configured — or if old/corrupt entries exist — the daemon fails repeatedly, causing log spam.
