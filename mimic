Hi David,

When reviewing technical candidates, here’s a framework you can use to better gauge their baseline competency before moving them to a technical interview.

You don’t need to be technical to do this — the goal is to ask the right kind of questions, listen for how confidently and logically they respond, and use follow-ups to see if they actually understand their experience.

1. Start With Foundational Questions

Ask basic, scenario-based questions to test their real-world troubleshooting and reasoning skills.
Examples:

“How do you patch systems? If a server fails to come back up after patching, what could be the issue and how would you fix it?”

“How would you troubleshoot a performance issue on a Linux system?”

You don’t need to verify technical accuracy — just note if they think through it logically and explain it clearly versus giving short or vague answers.

2. Drill Into Their Resume

Pick one or two tools or technologies they mention and ask follow-up questions to see if they’ve actually worked with them.
Examples:

If they list Docker or Kubernetes, ask:

“Can you tell me the difference between Docker and Kubernetes?”

“Can you describe a project where you deployed or managed containers?”

If they list Ansible, ask:

“What types of automation did you build with it?”

A candidate who’s hands-on will naturally walk you through what they did and why. Someone less experienced or AI-assisted will give shallow or inconsistent answers.

3. Recommend a 30-Minute Video Call

It’s best to set up a short 30-minute video call with each candidate rather than relying on chat or phone alone.
Seeing how they communicate and explain themselves in real time is one of the fastest ways to tell who’s genuinely confident versus who’s relying on notes or AI help.
