✅ SYSTEM ADMINISTRATION – Deep-Insight Questions

1. “Walk me through how you would troubleshoot high I/O wait on a Linux server.”

You’re looking for:
	•	iostat, pidstat -d, iotop, dstat
	•	Checking disk schedulers
	•	Checking mounts (NFS stalls?)
	•	Checking virtualization layer

Weak candidates talk CPU or memory. Strong ones go straight to disk latency and the right tools.

⸻

2. “If SSH is slow to log in, what do you check first?”

Expected:
	•	DNS resolution (UseDNS in sshd_config)
	•	GSSAPI settings
	•	PAM modules
	•	Reverse lookup timeouts
	•	Network latency

⸻

3. “How do you safely rotate logs on a busy system without causing app downtime?”

Looking for:
	•	logrotate with copytruncate vs create
	•	Knowing that some apps respond badly to in-place moves
	•	Systemd’s journalctl --vacuum-* for journal logs
	•	Understanding inode retention when deleting large files

⸻

4. “Explain how you’d isolate a process consuming too many file descriptors.”

Expected:
	•	lsof | wc -l
	•	/proc/<pid>/fd
	•	Checking ulimit and systemd unit LimitNOFILE=
	•	Understanding kernel panic risk for FD exhaustion

⸻

5. “Tell me everything that happens when a Linux VM boots, from BIOS to login prompt.”

Strong candidates mention:
	•	BIOS/UEFI → bootloader → kernel → initramfs → systemd → targets/services.

Weak candidates can’t.

✅ KUBERNETES – Real-World Ops Questions

1. “A pod is CrashLoopBackOff. What’s the exact systematic workflow to troubleshoot it?”

Expected:
	•	kubectl describe
	•	kubectl logs
	•	Check container exit code
	•	Check readiness/liveness probes
	•	Missing configmaps/secrets
	•	Image pull issues
	•	Look at events

Weak candidates jump straight to “check logs”.

⸻

2. “Explain the difference between readiness, liveness, and startup probes — when to use each.”

Good answer:
	•	Readiness → traffic control
	•	Liveness → restart unhealthy app
	•	Startup → slow-boot apps (JVM, DBs)

⸻

3. “Node NotReady — what are the top things you check?”

Expected:
	•	kubelet status
	•	Disk pressure / memory pressure
	•	cni0 or container runtime failures
	•	Network plugin logs (Calico/Cilium/Flannel)
	•	Certificates expiry
	•	Clock drift (NTP)

⸻

4. “How does Kubernetes networking work without NAT between pods?”

They should explain:
	•	Flat pod network
	•	CNI plugins
	•	IPAM responsibility
	•	Routing tables on worker nodes
	•	Why kube-proxy doesn’t touch pod-to-pod routing

⸻

5. “Your deployment rolled out a bad version. How do you revert cleanly?”

Expected:
	•	kubectl rollout undo
	•	Check ReplicaSets
	•	Use kubectl rollout status
	•	Validate readiness
	•	Why kubectl apply -f old.yaml is NOT ideal

⸻

6. “Explain how Kubernetes stores data. Why can etcd cause an outage with high memory pressure?”

Expect understanding of:
	•	etcd as raft-based KV
	•	QPS limits
	•	Fragmentation
	•	Defragmentation
	•	Encryption at rest

⸻

⸻

✅ NETWORKING – Real Troubleshooting Questions

1. “How do you debug a DNS issue inside a Kubernetes cluster?”

Expected:
	•	kubectl exec into a busybox container
	•	nslookup, dig, cat /etc/resolv.conf
	•	Check CoreDNS logs
	•	Check node DNS upstream config
	•	CNI MTU mismatches affecting DNS packets

⸻

2. “MTU mismatch — how do you detect it and what breaks?”

A strong candidate will mention:
	•	Symptoms (TCP retransmissions, slow traffic, hanging connections)
	•	Tools: ping -M do -s
	•	Path MTU discovery
	•	Calico / Cilium MTU settings

If they can’t explain MTU issues = weak.

⸻

3. “How do you trace packet flow from a pod to the outside world?”

Excellent answers involve:
	•	iptables -t nat -L
	•	kube-proxy rules
	•	CNI routing tables
	•	Using tcpdump on cni0 / host veth pair
	•	Kernel conntrack table

⸻

4. “What happens in an ARP broadcast? What tables get updated?”

Expect:
	•	ARP request/response
	•	MAC learning on switches
	•	ARP cache on hosts
	•	Why stale ARP causes outages

⸻

5. “Explain Layer 4 vs Layer 7 load balancing in the context of Kubernetes ingress.”

Should know:
	•	NodePort / ClusterIP = L4
	•	Ingress controller = L7
	•	NGINX vs HAProxy vs Envoy
	•	External LB integration

⸻

⸻

✅ ADVANCED SCENARIOS (For Senior-Level Filtering)

1. “You deploy a service, pods are running, but traffic never reaches them. Walk me through everything you’d check.”

Expected:
	•	Service selector mismatch
	•	IP tables rules
	•	Endpoints object empty
	•	CNI plugin logs
	•	Node firewall (UFW/iptables/nftables)
	•	Overlay network issues
	•	MTU mismatch
	•	Sidecar injection failure (Istio)

⸻

2. “Two pods can’t talk across namespaces; what do you check?”

Should mention:
	•	NetworkPolicy rules (most common)
	•	CNI plugin behavior
	•	Namespace-wide deny policies
	•	Wrong DNS name resolution

⸻

3. “Explain how Kubelet interacts with Container Runtime (CRI).”

Strong candidate:
	•	Kubelet → CRI shim → containerd / CRI-O
	•	Pod sandbox creation
	•	Network namespace creation
	•	Volume mount lifecycle

⸻

✅ If you want to REALLY test them

Ask:
“Explain Kubernetes to me like I’m a senior network engineer but new to containers.”
A strong engineer will break it down intelligently without buzzwords.
