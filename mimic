Title: Improve VKS8 Cluster Build Documentation Rendering and Structure

Description: While reviewing the VKS8 cluster build guide, we noticed the following issues:

The current documentation does not render well â€” formatting is cluttered and may confuse readers.
Repository links should be hyperlinked for easier access and cloning.
The document structure could benefit from clearer separation and reorganization for readability.
Recommendation:

Update the markdown or HTML rendering to ensure clean formatting.
Add proper hyperlinks to referenced repositories.
Reorganize sections for clarity and ensure instructions are logically grouped.
