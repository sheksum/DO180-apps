This task is to look into different open-source tools that can help us automate and manage both our RHEL and Oracle Linux systems using Ansible. The goal is to understand what AWX offers and compare it with a couple of other open-source options so we can decide which one fits our environment best.

We’re mainly looking for a tool that gives us a clean UI, handles credentials properly, works with GitLab, and can centralize automation across both operating systems without relying on anything proprietary.


Understand What We Need

 Figure out what the automation needs are for RHEL

 Do the same for Oracle Linux

 Identify what we need in terms of UI, RBAC, API access

 Confirm what GitLab integration should look like

 Note any network or security requirements

Look at the Tools

 Review AWX and what it can do

 Check Semaphore as a simpler alternative

 Review Rundeck with its Ansible plugin

 Compare features and limitations across the tools

 Make sure each tool works well across both RHEL and Oracle Linux

Make a Recommendation

 Summarize what each tool does well (and not so well)

 Consider how easy each one is to maintain long-term

 Recommend the tool that makes the most sense

 Outline what the architecture would look like

 Identify what the next steps should be

Figure out what the automation needs are for RHEL

RHEL systems need a platform that can handle:

Patch orchestration (kernel updates, reboots, package updates)

Baseline configuration (SSH hardening, chrony, firewall rules)

User and key management (automation user, sudo rules)

Compliance checks (CIS/STIG roles)

Inventory grouping by environment (dev/stage/prod)

Credential-based or key-based access using an automation account

AWX can manage all of these since RHEL has strong Ansible support and collections from Red Hat.

Do the same for Oracle Linux

Oracle Linux requires:

Patch workflows using dnf with Oracle-specific repos

Baseline configuration similar to RHEL but with OL differences (kernel, repo paths, python paths)

Support for Ksplice (if your company uses it)

Oracle-specific Ansible collections (oracle.olsystem, oracle.olle)

Ability to manage both UEK kernel systems and non-UEK systems

AWX (or any Ansible controller) can handle these as long as we have Oracle execution environments.

Identify what we need in terms of UI, RBAC, API access

What the team needs:

A simple UI where automation jobs can be launched without CLI

Role-based access so teams only see what they are supposed to

Ability to restrict credentials to certain teams or projects

Job templates with pre-defined safe options

API access for GitLab CI/CD or Service team automation

Audit trail of who ran what and when

Separation of dev/test/prod automation run spaces
AWX provides all of these out of the box.

Confirm what GitLab integration should look like

We need:

AWX to pull playbooks directly from GitLab (no local copies)

GitLab deploy keys or personal access tokens for secure repo access

Branch-based workflows (dev/stage/prod)

Optional webhooks (run a job when a repo changes)

A place to store Ansible Collections, roles, EE definitions, inventories

GitLab Runner (optional) for building Execution Environment images
AWX integrates cleanly with GitLab and supports GitOps-style automation.

Note any network or security requirements

Security needs:

Only outbound SSH from AWX to managed servers (no inbound from servers)

Inbound 443 access only for AWX UI/API

Secure credential storage (SSH keys, tokens, vault passwords)

Option to integrate with LDAP/IdM/AD for authentication

Option to place AWX in DMZ or behind a reverse proxy depending on access needs

Execution Environment image registry must be reachable (internal registry recommended)

Network needs:

K3s node must reach:

GitLab

RHEL and Oracle hosts

Postgres (if external DB is used)

Internal registry (for EE images)

Load balancer (optional) if HA is later required

SELinux considerations depending on OS/hardening
