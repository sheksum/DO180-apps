This task is to look into different open-source tools that can help us automate and manage both our RHEL and Oracle Linux systems using Ansible. The goal is to understand what AWX offers and compare it with a couple of other open-source options so we can decide which one fits our environment best.

We’re mainly looking for a tool that gives us a clean UI, handles credentials properly, works with GitLab, and can centralize automation across both operating systems without relying on anything proprietary.


Understand What We Need

 Figure out what the automation needs are for RHEL

 Do the same for Oracle Linux

 Identify what we need in terms of UI, RBAC, API access

 Confirm what GitLab integration should look like

 Note any network or security requirements

Look at the Tools

 Review AWX and what it can do

 Check Semaphore as a simpler alternative

 Review Rundeck with its Ansible plugin

 Compare features and limitations across the tools

 Make sure each tool works well across both RHEL and Oracle Linux

Make a Recommendation

 Summarize what each tool does well (and not so well)

 Consider how easy each one is to maintain long-term

 Recommend the tool that makes the most sense

 Outline what the architecture would look like

 Identify what the next steps should be

Figure out what the automation needs are for RHEL

RHEL systems need a platform that can handle:

Patch orchestration (kernel updates, reboots, package updates)

Baseline configuration (SSH hardening, chrony, firewall rules)

User and key management (automation user, sudo rules)

Compliance checks (CIS/STIG roles)

Inventory grouping by environment (dev/stage/prod)

Credential-based or key-based access using an automation account

AWX can manage all of these since RHEL has strong Ansible support and collections from Red Hat.

Do the same for Oracle Linux

Oracle Linux requires:

Patch workflows using dnf with Oracle-specific repos

Baseline configuration similar to RHEL but with OL differences (kernel, repo paths, python paths)

Support for Ksplice (if your company uses it)

Oracle-specific Ansible collections (oracle.olsystem, oracle.olle)

Ability to manage both UEK kernel systems and non-UEK systems

AWX (or any Ansible controller) can handle these as long as we have Oracle execution environments.

Identify what we need in terms of UI, RBAC, API access

What the team needs:

A simple UI where automation jobs can be launched without CLI

Role-based access so teams only see what they are supposed to

Ability to restrict credentials to certain teams or projects

Job templates with pre-defined safe options

API access for GitLab CI/CD or Service team automation

Audit trail of who ran what and when

Separation of dev/test/prod automation run spaces
AWX provides all of these out of the box.

Confirm what GitLab integration should look like

We need:

AWX to pull playbooks directly from GitLab (no local copies)

GitLab deploy keys or personal access tokens for secure repo access

Branch-based workflows (dev/stage/prod)

Optional webhooks (run a job when a repo changes)

A place to store Ansible Collections, roles, EE definitions, inventories

GitLab Runner (optional) for building Execution Environment images
AWX integrates cleanly with GitLab and supports GitOps-style automation.

Note any network or security requirements

Security needs:

Only outbound SSH from AWX to managed servers (no inbound from servers)

Inbound 443 access only for AWX UI/API

Secure credential storage (SSH keys, tokens, vault passwords)

Option to integrate with LDAP/IdM/AD for authentication

Option to place AWX in DMZ or behind a reverse proxy depending on access needs

Execution Environment image registry must be reachable (internal registry recommended)

Network needs:

K3s node must reach:

GitLab

RHEL and Oracle hosts

Postgres (if external DB is used)

Internal registry (for EE images)

Load balancer (optional) if HA is later required

SELinux considerations depending on OS/hardening





AWX – Automation Controller Platform
Overview

As part of our ongoing platform and automation work, we are evaluating AWX as a centralized orchestration platform for running Ansible at scale.

Red Hat Satellite is already deployed and continues to serve as the primary lifecycle and content management platform for RHEL systems. However, there is currently no equivalent orchestration solution in place for Oracle Linux, nor a shared automation control plane that spans both platforms.

This effort focuses on evaluating AWX as a complementary automation controller that fills those gaps while aligning with our broader move toward containerized, Kubernetes-based platform services.

Progress on this work is being tracked through a dedicated set of Trello cards, with each card representing a specific phase of evaluation, design, or implementation.

What We’re Trying to Achieve

This initiative is not about replacing existing tooling. It is about extending automation capabilities in a consistent and scalable way.

Current State

Red Hat Satellite

Effectively manages RHEL lifecycle (content, patching, inventory)

Limited scope for Oracle Linux

Not designed as a general-purpose orchestration engine

Automation outside Satellite

Primarily host- or user-driven

Inconsistent execution patterns

No shared orchestration layer across platforms

Target State

A centralized orchestration platform for Ansible

Unified automation for RHEL and Oracle Linux

Git-driven workflows and repeatable execution

Strong RBAC and credential isolation

A solution that fits naturally into a Kubernetes-based platform model

AWX is being evaluated specifically to act as this orchestration layer alongside Satellite.

What is AWX?

AWX is the open-source upstream project for Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform.
It provides a web UI, API, and execution framework for running Ansible in a controlled, repeatable manner.

In practical terms, AWX provides:

Centralized execution of Ansible playbooks

Inventory and credential management

Role-based access control

Job templates and workflows

Containerized execution environments for consistency

AWX removes the need to run automation directly from engineer workstations or ad-hoc jump hosts and instead treats automation as a shared platform service.

High-Level Architecture (Conceptual)

At a high level, AWX is intended to run as a platform service on Kubernetes:

RHEL 9 hosts provide the underlying operating system

Kubernetes (under evaluation: K3s vs Rancher-managed Kubernetes) hosts the control plane

AWX runs as containerized workloads managed by the AWX Operator

PostgreSQL is used as the backend database

Execution Environments run Ansible jobs in isolated containers

Git repositories act as the source of truth for automation content

This design allows the platform to start small while supporting future growth, HA, and integration with other platform services.

Work Tracking via Trello
