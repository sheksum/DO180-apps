This task is to look into different open-source tools that can help us automate and manage both our RHEL and Oracle Linux systems using Ansible. The goal is to understand what AWX offers and compare it with a couple of other open-source options so we can decide which one fits our environment best.

We’re mainly looking for a tool that gives us a clean UI, handles credentials properly, works with GitLab, and can centralize automation across both operating systems without relying on anything proprietary.
