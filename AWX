This task is to look into different open-source tools that can help us automate and manage both our RHEL and Oracle Linux systems using Ansible. The goal is to understand what AWX offers and compare it with a couple of other open-source options so we can decide which one fits our environment best.

We’re mainly looking for a tool that gives us a clean UI, handles credentials properly, works with GitLab, and can centralize automation across both operating systems without relying on anything proprietary.


Understand What We Need

 Figure out what the automation needs are for RHEL

 Do the same for Oracle Linux

 Identify what we need in terms of UI, RBAC, API access

 Confirm what GitLab integration should look like

 Note any network or security requirements

Look at the Tools

 Review AWX and what it can do

 Check Semaphore as a simpler alternative

 Review Rundeck with its Ansible plugin

 Compare features and limitations across the tools

 Make sure each tool works well across both RHEL and Oracle Linux

Make a Recommendation

 Summarize what each tool does well (and not so well)

 Consider how easy each one is to maintain long-term

 Recommend the tool that makes the most sense

 Outline what the architecture would look like

 Identify what the next steps should be
